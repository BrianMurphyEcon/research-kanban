  **Design Movement**: Academic Brutalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Expose the structure of the research process without hiding behind metaphors.
  2. **Information Density**: Maximize the visibility of critical data (deadlines, co-authors, status) without clutter.
  3. **High Contrast**: Use stark black and white with a single, bold accent color (e.g., electric blue or signal orange) to highlight action items.
  4. **Monospace Typography**: Emphasize the "work in progress" nature of research with code-like aesthetics.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Off-white (#F5F5F5) or raw concrete gray (#E0E0E0) to reduce eye strain during long sessions.
  - **Text**: Deep charcoal (#1A1A1A) for readability.
  - **Accent**: International Klein Blue (#002FA7) for active states and drag indicators.
  - **Intent**: To create a space that feels like a digital workbench—utilitarian, robust, and focused on the output.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Horizontal Scroll**: A continuous, infinite canvas for columns, mimicking a physical whiteboard.
  - **Modular Cards**: Cards are strictly rectangular with sharp edges, resembling index cards or punch cards.
  - **Visible Grid**: Subtle grid lines in the background to align thoughts and structures.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: 2px-3px solid borders for columns and cards to define boundaries clearly.
  - **Typewriter Headers**: Section headers that look like stamped text.
  - **Progress Bars**: Raw, unrounded progress bars that fill up with the accent color.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions should feel tactile and mechanical—snappy drag-and-drop, distinct click sounds (visual feedback).
  - **Hover Reveals**: Detailed metadata (links, notes) appears only on hover to keep the main view clean.

  **Animation**:
  - **Instant Transitions**: Minimal easing; things snap into place immediately.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch or typewriter effects on text updates to emphasize the "drafting" process.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Courier Prime` (Bold, Uppercase).
  - **Body**: `Inter` or `Roboto` (Regular) for legibility in dense text areas.

  **Design Movement**: Soft Minimalist Study
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Calm Focus**: A distraction-free environment that encourages deep work and concentration.
  2. **Organic Shapes**: Rounded corners and fluid forms to reduce cognitive load and visual tension.
  3. **Warmth**: Use of warm neutrals and natural tones to make the digital space feel inviting, like a well-lit library.
  4. **Tactile Depth**: Subtle shadows and layering to mimic physical paper on a desk.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Warm cream (#FDFBF7) or soft beige (#F5F2EB).
  - **Text**: Dark warm gray (#4A4A4A) rather than pure black.
  - **Palette**: Muted earth tones—sage green, terracotta, slate blue—for tagging and categorization.
  - **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of a quiet, organized study room where ideas can incubate peacefully.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Columns**: Columns appear as floating panels on a continuous desk-like background.
  - **Card Stacks**: Cards have a slight "stack" effect to imply depth and volume.
  - **Centered Focus**: The active column or card is subtly highlighted, while others recede slightly.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Paper Texture**: A very subtle grain texture on the background to simulate paper.
  - **Soft Shadows**: Diffused, large-radius shadows to lift elements off the "page."
  - **Rounded Tags**: Pill-shaped tags for keywords and status indicators.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid Drag**: Dragging feels like sliding a paper across a smooth desk—with inertia and gentle resistance.
  - **Soft Modals**: Clicking a card opens a modal that expands from the card itself, maintaining context.

  **Animation**:
  - **Ease-Out**: Smooth, slow ease-out animations for all movements.
  - **Fade-Ins**: Elements gently fade in rather than popping into existence.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `Lora` or `Merriweather` (Serif) for a literary, academic feel.
  - **Body**: `Nunito` or `Lato` (Sans-serif) for approachable, easy reading.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss International Style (Digital Adaptation)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: Strict adherence to a mathematical grid for alignment and proportion.
  2. **Objective Clarity**: Prioritize the content above all else; the design is a neutral vessel for data.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Use asymmetrical layouts to create dynamic tension and guide the eye.
  4. **Sans-Serif Purity**: Exclusive use of clean, geometric sans-serif typefaces.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#F0F0F0).
  - **Text**: Black (#000000) for maximum contrast.
  - **Accents**: Primary colors (Red #FF0000, Blue #0000FF, Yellow #FFFF00) used sparingly for critical indicators.
  - **Intent**: To present research as a structured, scientific endeavor—clean, precise, and universally understandable.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: The entire board is built on a visible or invisible modular grid.
  - **Vertical Rhythm**: Consistent vertical spacing between all elements.
  - **Whitespace as Structure**: Use whitespace to separate columns and groups, rather than lines or borders.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Bold Dividers**: Thick horizontal rules to separate major sections.
  - **Large Typography**: Oversized headings for column titles to create hierarchy.
  - **Iconography**: Minimalist, geometric icons (if used at all).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Direct Manipulation**: Interactions are immediate and predictable.
  - **Contextual Tools**: Tools appear exactly where needed, aligned to the grid.

  **Animation**:
  - **Linear/Quick**: Fast, linear transitions that don't waste time.
  - **Scale**: subtle scaling effects to indicate selection.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: `Helvetica Now` or `Inter` (Bold/Black) – tight tracking.
  - **Body**: `Inter` or `Roboto` (Regular) – normal tracking.
